# MailDesk

# ABOUT THE PROJECT:

A full-stack mailing service web app using Django (backend), HTML/CSS with Bootstrap and JavaScript (frontend), and SQLite (database).

Enabled users to send emails to other registered users, with support for reply and archiving /unarchiving mails.

Implemented dynamic UI updates such as background color changes based on read/unread mail status.
